The 2015 Birmingham Sports Awards will culminate in a lavish awards ceremony on the 17 September 2015, at Aston Villa Football Club. Guests will be welcomed to the evening with a Champagne reception before enjoying a fabulous three course gourmet meal. Following this, the friends and family of the finalists are invited to join the evening to watch the ceremony, where the winner of each category will be announced. A host of sporting celebrities will attend the evening and will present each award alongside the category sponsor.

The night will raise money for Stiliyan Petrov Foundation and the Birmingham Olympic Legacy Tour 2015.

Established in 2013, the Stilyan Petrov Foundation aims to help address the issues involved when people are diagnosed with acute leukaemia. Petrov is a retired footballer best known for his seven year stint with Aston Villa, during which he became captain. In March 2012, he was diagnosed with the condition which affects 2,300 people in the UK each year. He found the diagnosis touched people and he wanted to channel this in a positive way. The Foundation provides a vital support infrastructure, a way that will help families to be near to their loved ones while they undergo the treatment.

The City Council hosted the Jamaican Track and Field Pre-Olympic 2012 Training Camp in Birmingham. An integral part of this project was the commitment to the delivery of four Olympic legacy initiatives focused on athletics, netball, cricket and football between the City of Birmingham and Jamaica. To date, two of the legacy initiatives have been delivered with the cricket legacy project scheduled for 2015. In short the vision is for a group of recreational cricketers from the local area to represent the city of Birmingham out in Jamaica, further developing the social, cultural and sporting links that Birmingham has with the island.
