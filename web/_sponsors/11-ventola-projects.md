Community-focused events like the Birmingham Sports Awards bring people together in celebration, which can only be a positive thing for the entire region, and everyone at Ventola Projects is delighted to be involved with this year&rsquo;s awards. We are particularly pleased to sponsor the Lifetime Achievement Award, which recognises qualities that we have natural affinity with: hard work, perseverance and a dedication to excellence. We are looking forward to celebrating all of this year&rsquo;s finalists and crowning the very worthy winners. Birmingham has a huge amount of sporting talent to be proud of and we are looking forward to shining a spotlight on it.
