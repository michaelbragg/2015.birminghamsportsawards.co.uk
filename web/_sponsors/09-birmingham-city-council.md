Birmingham City Council is very proud to be the sponsor of Volunteer of the Year Award for the Birmingham Sports Awards 2015.

We have a fantastic base of enthusiastic and knowledgeable volunteers who continue to provide an exceptional amount of support across our parks, community sport and events throughout the year. Without these committed and loyal volunteers the majority of formal and informal sport, activities and events would simply not take place.

As a city we would like to personally express our gratitude to these volunteers by officially sponsoring this award.
