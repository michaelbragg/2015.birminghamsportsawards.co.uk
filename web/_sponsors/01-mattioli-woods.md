"Mattioli Woods plc is again very proud to sponsor the Birmingham Sports Awards – I can’t believe it has been a year since we celebrated some great local sporting talent in the City.  Birmingham is
renowned for its sporting heritage and as a Midlands-based business, we believe that sport brings many benefits to the local community. By sharing such inspiring success stories, the Birmingham awards brings a true sense of pride to the area and help to encourage other aspiring individuals and teams.  We are particularly excited to sponsor the ‘Manager/Coach of the Year’ category as we believe that these individuals often go unnoticed but provide the essential leadership, co-ordination and encouragement needed to enable people to achieve their full potential.  Good luck to all the nominees from Mattioli Woods!"
