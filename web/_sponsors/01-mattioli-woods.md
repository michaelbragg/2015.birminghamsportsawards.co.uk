Mattioli Woods plc is again very proud to sponsor the Birmingham Sports Awards. Birmingham is renowned for its sporting heritage and there is some amazing sporting talent in the area. As a Midlands-based business, we believe that sport brings many benefits to the local community. By sharing its success stories, the BSA brings a great sense of pride to the area and helps to encourage other aspiring individuals and teams in the future.

We are particularly excited to sponsor the &lsquo;Manager/Coach of the Year&rsquo; category as we believe that these individuals often go unnoticed but provide the essential leadership, co-ordination and encouragement needed to enable people to achieve their full potential. Good luck to all the nominees from Mattioli Woods!
